# jtag_generate

Create a VCD file containing JTAG transactions described in the
python script.

The script depends on the [pyvcd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvcd) package that allows creating
easily VCD files.  If one does not wish to install this package globally on the machine, it is possible
to download locally the vcd module of the package from the [github](https://github.com/SanDisk-Open-Source/pyvcd) repository.
